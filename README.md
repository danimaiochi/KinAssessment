# KinAssessment

This is the project for the Kin And Carta Assessment.

The idea behind it is to be able to add a list of products and get the total value.
Certain discount rules can be added before and after the calculation.

## Before
The rules for Before are the rules that will change the price per item.
For example, if buying X of the item Y, the price is modified.

## After
The rules for After are the rules that will calculate after the entire price is known.
For example, if value >= X, we give Y% discount.
